# smarthack-2026-pingfloyd — netcheck

**Secure Networks, Simply Explained** — R Systems Hackathon 2026.
Scans a small network *you own*, explains the risks in plain Romanian/English and tells you exactly how to fix them.

## Setup

Python 3.10+. The core needs only the standard library.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt      # defusedxml (safer XML) + pytest
cp .env.example .env                 # optional: only if you change defaults (users need nothing)
```

## Analyse scan files (offline, no admin rights)

```bash
python -m netcheck analyze <folder-with-xml> --out results     # -> results/findings.csv, results/scores.csv
python -m netcheck report  scan.xml --lang ro                  # plain-language report
python -m netcheck ask     scan.xml "Ce să repar primul?"      # AI assistant (falls back to built-in text)
python -m netcheck chat    scan.xml                            # conversation with the assistant
python -m netcheck diff    before.xml after.xml                # what changed / what got fixed
```

Unreadable files get `ERROR` in `scores.csv`; the run continues with the other files.

## How it works

| Layer | What | LLM? |
|---|---|---|
| `netcheck/core/parser.py` | Safe nmap XML parsing: no DTD/entities, size limit, untrusted text clipped | no |
| `netcheck/core/rules.py` | Official finding catalog + detection rules, standard score | **no**: deterministic |
| `netcheck/core/diff.py` | Before/after comparison, new device / new port alerts | no |
| `netcheck/explain/texts.py` | Human-reviewed RO/EN explanations (max 2 sentences) + 1–5 fix steps, CIS/OWASP refs | no |
| `netcheck/ai/` | Q&A assistant client: sends a minimal, privacy-preserving context to our gateway; every answer is checked by a grounding guard (no IPs, ports, CVEs, links or phone numbers not in the scan) | yes, optional |
| `gateway/` | Team-hosted AI gateway: holds the API key, calls Claude Haiku 5.5 (or optional local Ollama); users configure nothing | yes |

Findings, severities and scores never come from the LLM. If the API is unavailable, slow, or an answer
fails the grounding check, the assistant returns a deterministic built-in answer.

### Rule assumptions (to confirm with mentors)
* Only ports with state exactly `open` count (`open|filtered` does not).
* `HTTP_ADMIN_CLEARTEXT` requires service name `http` without `tunnel="ssl"`.
* Samba ranges like `3.X - 4.X` are judged by the upper bound (not flagged).

## AI assistant: app → our gateway → Claude

```
netcheck app (user, no key) --HTTPS--> gateway (team machine, has the key) --HTTPS--> Claude API (Haiku 5.5)
     ^ falls back to built-in text if the gateway is down, over its limits, or the answer is not grounded
```

* **Users configure nothing and hold no key.** The app calls `NETCHECK_AI_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`).
  For a distributed app, point the default at the gateway's public `https://` address.
* **The API key lives only on the gateway machine**, in `.env` (git-ignored). Tests check that the app code
  never reads a key and that the gateway never prints it.
* **Privacy:** only device type, vendor, private IP, open ports and findings are sent. Hostnames,
  MAC addresses, raw XML and history never leave the user's machine. The gateway whitelists fields
  and does not log request content or client IPs.
* **Cost / abuse protection:** per-IP rate limit, daily cap on model calls (`NETCHECK_GATEWAY_DAILY_LIMIT`),
  body limit, max 1024 output tokens (thinking off by default), strict request contract, `/health` never calls the model.
  A question costs roughly a tenth of a cent with Haiku 5.5; also set a spend limit in the Claude Console.
* **Grounding:** the gateway checks every answer (one retry), the app checks it again.
* **Conversations:** the gateway is stateless; the app keeps the last 6 question/answer pairs and sends
  them with each question (`Conversation` in `netcheck/ai/assistant.py`, `python -m netcheck chat`).
* **Errors:** model errors (bad key, no credits, unknown model) are printed in the gateway console and
  shown by the app with the reason; the key is never included.
* Optional: `NETCHECK_GATEWAY_BACKEND=ollama` runs a local model instead (no key needed).

### Run the gateway (team machine)

```powershell
copy .env.example .env        # put your key in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File gateway\run.ps1      # or: python -m gateway
python -m netcheck ask tests\fixtures\synthetic\V2_smart_home.xml "Ce repar primul?"
python tools/eval_assistant.py                               # 10 fixed questions -> eval_results.md
```

To make it reachable for users on other machines, expose it through an HTTPS tunnel
(e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel) and set `NETCHECK_GATEWAY_TOKEN` + `NETCHECK_GATEWAY_TRUST_PROXY=1`.

## Tests

```bash
python tools/make_synthetic_fixtures.py   # synthetic look-alikes of the Validation Set
python -m pytest -q
```

Put the real Validation Set (with `expected_findings.csv` / `expected_scores.csv`) in
`tests/fixtures/validation/`; the golden test picks it up automatically.

## Secrets check

```bash
gitleaks detect --source . -v
```
